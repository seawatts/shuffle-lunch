Subject: You're in for shuffle lunch {{pdate}}

Howdy! This is your reminder email that you're opted-in for the shuffle lunches every other Thursday. (When I don't screw up and miss one).

You're opted-in, so you get the idea:
• If you want out, send me an email by 11:59pm Tuesday
• You've entered in the past, so I'll assume you're in unless you say otherwise
• I pick random teams of 4-6 members
• I'll send you an email by 11am Wednesday

Teams are randomly selected for each lunch.

*If you don't opt out, I will put you on a team.*

Please email me if you want out of the shuffle lunch next Thursday, {{pdate}}.
