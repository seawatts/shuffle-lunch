Subject: Shuffle lunch {{pdate}}

Howdy everyone! This is your reminder email about the shuffle lunches every other Thursday. (When I don't screw up and miss one).

The idea is simple:
• If you want in, send me an email by 11:59pm Tuesday
• If you've entered in the past, I'll assume you're in unless you say otherwise
• I toss those names in a (now digital) hat and randomly pick out teams of 4-6 members
• I'll send you an email by 11am Wednesday
• You pick whatever restaurant you want as a team

Teams are randomly selected for each lunch.

*Everyone who sends me an email will be put on a team.*

Please email me if you want in on the shuffle lunch next Thursday, {{pdate}}. If you like, you can opt-in so you're in the lunches by default. Just let me know!
